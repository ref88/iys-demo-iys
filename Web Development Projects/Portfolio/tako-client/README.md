# 🍽️ TAKO VMS Client - The Dining Room

## 🏗️ What This Is (Restaurant Analogy)

Think of this as the **dining room** of a restaurant:
- **Beautiful interface** where customers (users) interact
- **Menus and displays** showing information (React components)
- **Waiters** that take orders and bring food (API calls)
- **No cooking happens here** - all food comes from the kitchen (server)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (set up the dining room)
npm install

# Start development server (open the restaurant)
npm run dev

# Build for production (prepare for grand opening)
npm run build
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Waiter System (API Service)
```javascript
// Waiter takes order to kitchen
const residents = await apiService.getResidents();

// If kitchen is closed, use emergency snacks (localStorage)
// Graceful fallback - restaurant stays open!
```

### Environment Configurations
- **Development**: Talks to kitchen at `localhost:3001`
- **Production**: Talks to kitchen at `/api`

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-time Dashboard** - Live view of restaurant status
- **Resident Management** - Customer database and profiles
- **Offline Support** - Works even when kitchen is closed
- **Multi-language** - Dutch and English menus
- **Responsive Design** - Works on phones, tablets, computers

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development (open dining room)
npm run build        # Build for production (grand opening prep)
npm run preview      # Preview production build (rehearsal)
npm run lint         # Check code quality (inspect dining room)
npm run test         # Run tests (quality control)
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation (safety inspection)
```

## 🌐 Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for your personal settings:
```bash

## 🏭 Architecture Philosophy

### Restaurant Analogy Learning
This project uses **restaurant analogies** to explain technical concepts:

- **Client (this repo)** = Dining room where customers eat
- **Server (separate repo)** = Kitchen where food is prepared  
- **API calls** = Waiters carrying orders and food
- **Components** = Tables, chairs, and dining room furniture
- **State** = Current atmosphere and activity in dining room
- **Props** = Ingredients passed between kitchen stations

### Why Analogies Matter
- **Instant understanding** - Complex concepts become clear
- **Better communication** - Team members speak same language
- **Easier debugging** - "The waiter isn't reaching the kitchen" vs "API call failing"
- **Learning retention** - Real-world connections stick better

## 🔗 Related Repositories

- **tako-server** - The kitchen (backend API)
- **tako-docs** - Restaurant manual (documentation)

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Calm & Professional UX
- **Gentle animations** - Smooth, mature transitions (400-600ms)
- **Subtle movements** - No jarring effects or bounces
- **Professional feel** - Like a high-end restaurant, not fast food
- **Predictable interactions** - Users always know what will happen

### Component Philosophy
- **Reusable furniture** - Build once, use everywhere
- **Clean interfaces** - Simple props, clear responsibilities
- **Accessibility first** - Everyone can dine comfortably
- **Performance focused** - Fast loading, smooth interactions

## 🚀 Deployment

This dining room can be deployed anywhere:
- **Netlify** - Easy drag-and-drop deployment
- **Vercel** - Git integration with previews
- **AWS S3** - Enterprise hosting solution
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment (coming soon)

## 🤝 Contributing

1. **Check out the dining room** - `git clone` and `npm install`
2. **Make improvements** - Add new furniture or fix existing pieces
3. **Test everything** - `npm run test` and `npm run lint`
4. **Submit changes** - Pull request with clear description

## 📞 Support

If the dining room has issues:
- Check if the kitchen (server) is running
- Verify waiter routes (API endpoints) are correct
- Look for error messages in browser console
- Check network tab for failed requests
